# Mood Tracker Application

This is a web application built with Laravel and Bootstrap that allows users to log their daily moods, view a history of their entries, and filter them by date.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Mood Logging:** Users can log their daily mood with a specific type (e.g., Happy, Sad, Calm) and an optional note.
- **History View:** A table displays a chronological history of all logged moods.
- **Date Range Filtering:** Users can filter their mood history by a specific date range.
- **Soft Delete & Restore:** Mood entries are soft-deleted, meaning they can be restored later from a dedicated "Trashed" view.
- **Export to PDF:** The filtered mood history can be exported as a PDF document.
- **Mood Streak:** A streak counter is displayed on the dashboard to encourage consistent logging.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, modern user interface designed with Bootstrap 5.
